> ‚ÄºÔ∏è **Command Line Interface (CLI) Option**: If you'd like to extract CSI without having to code your own application, there is the CLI wrapper that was created for that purpose. The CLI also gives access to all the features available in this crate. Check out the [`esp-csi-cli-rs`](https://github.com/theembeddedrustacean/esp-csi-cli-rs) repository where you can flash a pre-built binary. This allows you to interact with your board/device immediately wihtout the need to code your own application.


## Overview

`esp_csi_rs` builds on top of Espressif's low-level abstractions to enable easy CSI collection on embedded ESP devices. The crate supports various WiFi modes and network configurations and integrates with the `esp-wifi` and `embassy` async ecosystems.

## Features
### ‚úÖ Device Support
`esp-csi-rs` supports several ESP devices including the ESP32-C6 which supports WiFi 6. The current list of supported devices are:
- ESP32
- ESP32-C2
- ESP32-C3
- ESP32-C6
- ESP32-S3

### ‚úÖ Host Interface
With exception to the ESP32 and the ESP32-C2, `esp-csi-rs` leverages the `USB-JTAG-SERIAL` peripheral available on many recent ESP development boards. This allows for higher baud rates compared to using the traditional UART interface.

### ‚úÖ `defmt`
`esp-csi-rs` reduces device to host transfer overhead further by supporting `defmt`. `defmt` is a highly efficient logging framework introduced by Ferrous Systems that targets resource-constrained devices. More detail about `defmt` can be found [here](https://defmt.ferrous-systems.com/).

### ‚úÖ Traffic Generation
When setting up a CSI collection system, dummy traffic on the network is needed to exchange packets that encapsulate the CSI data. `esp-csi-rs` in turn allows you to generate either ICMP (simple ping) or UDP traffic. The crate also allows you to control the intervals at which traffic is generated. ICMP is lighter weight, however, does not carry any application data. UDP allows for the transfer of application data if needed. However, this is a feature not enabled yet. 

### ‚úÖ NTP Timestamp
In architechtres involving a connection to a commercial router with internet access,the ESP device synchronizes with an NTP time server. Afterward, the acquired timestamp is associated with every recieved CSI packet.

### ‚úÖ Network Architechtures
`esp-csi-rs` allows you to configure a device to one several modes including access point, station, or sniffer. You would need at least `esp-csi-rs` supports several architechtural setups allowing for flexibility in collection of CSI. These architechtures can be configured programmatically through the crate configuration options. `esp-csi-rs` supports four different architechtures as follows:

1. <span style="color:red">***Sniffer***</span>: This is the simplest setup where only one ESP device is needed. The device is configured to "sniff" packets on surrounding networks and extract CSI data.
2. <span style="color:red">***RouterStation***</span>: In this setup only one ESP device is needed as well and is configrued as a Station. The ESP station then connects to a commercial router instead. As menntioned earlier, setups including a commercial router have the advantage of syncronizing with an NTP time server. The station sends traffic to the commercial router to acquire CSI data.
3. <span style="color:red">***AccessPointStation***</span>: This setup requires the use of at least two ESP devices, one configured as a Station and one as an Access Point. The station sends traffic to the access point to acquire CSI data. This architechure is also expandable where additional stations can be introduces to connect to the central Access point. 
4. <span style="color:red">***RouterAccessPointStation***</span>:This setup requires the use of at least two ESP devices, one configured as a Station and one as an Access Point + Station. The ESP Access Point + Station connects to a commercial router for internet access while simultaneously providing the ability for stations to connect to it for CSI data. This architechure is also expandable where additional stations can be introduces to connect to the central Access Point + Station.

## Getting Started

To use `esp_csi_rs` in your project, create an ESP `no-std` project set up using the `esp-generate` tool (modify the chip/device accordingly):

```sh
cargo install esp-generate
esp-generate --chip=esp32c3 your-project
```

Add the crate to your `Cargo.toml`. At a minimum, you would need to specify the device and the desired logging framework (`println` or `defmt`):

```toml
esp-csi-rs = { version = "0.1.0", features = ["esp32c3", "println"] }
```

> ‚ÄºÔ∏è The selected logging framework needs to align with the selected framework for the `esp-backtrace` dependency

## Usage Example
This is the simplest example of how this crate can be used. This example follows a sniffer architechture where only one ESP device is needed. This example sets up the ESP to sniff packets of the surrounding networks and print out CSI data to the console.

```rust
use esp_csi_rs::{CSICollector, WiFiMode};

let mut collector = CSICollector::new_with_defaults();
collector.set_op_mode(WiFiMode::Sniffer);
collector.start(10).await;
```
Everytime CSI data is captured, the resulting output looks like this:
```bash

```

## More Examples
The repository contains an example folder that contains examples for various device configurations. To run any of the examples enter the following to your command line:
```bash
cargo run --example <example-name>
```
Just replace `example-name` with the file name of any of the examples.
